(ns mining-metallurgy.store
  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 3117 mining and metallurgical technicians field test
  and inspection actor. Store is a protocol injected into the `mining-metallurgy.
  actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the default, deterministic, zero-dep backend;
  a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed implementation can be swapped in without
  touching the actor or governor (itonami actor pattern, per
  ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  Domain:

    project  — a registered mining/metallurgical project (:project-id, :name, :location)
    record   — a committed test/inspection record under a project
               (ore/metal sample test data, inspection log, site visit note) —
               written ONLY via commit-record!, never mutated in place
    ledger   — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
               disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
